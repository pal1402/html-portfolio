<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
With a solid foundation in Computer Science & Engineering from Parul University, 
I have developed a deep understanding of technical concepts and analytical skills. 
My education has been augmented with a Postgraduate Program in Business and Information
Systems Architecture at Fanshawe College, where I honed my abilities in aligning 
business processes with technological solutions. 
This unique blend of technical and business education equips me to effectively 
translate complex technical requirements into actionable business strategies, 
a skill I demonstrated as a Research Associate at NielsenIQ.

In my role at NielsenIQ, I was responsible for managing report development, 
leading to the successful delivery of over 500 consumer insights reports for 
major clients like P&G and Mondelez. This role required meticulous attention to detail,
 exceptional project management skills, and the ability to communicate effectively with
 diverse teams. I am proud of having achieved high-quality standards in this position, 
 as evidenced by earning 5,340 bravo points for my dedication to accuracy and 
 efficiency. These experiences have honed my skills in business architecture design, 
 software system specifications, and database modeling, enabling me to contribute 
 significantly to complex software solutions in n-tier development environments.

  Recently, I have embarked on a journey into the world of web development. 
  This new venture has allowed me to apply my foundational knowledge in computer 
  science to create engaging and functional web applications. Although I am relatively 
  new to this field, I have already begun working on several projects that showcase my
   growing skills in web technologies. This expansion into web development not only 
   reflects my passion for continuous learning and adaptability but also enhances my 
   ability to offer comprehensive technical solutions that span various aspects of 
   software development.
